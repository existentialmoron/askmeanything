# AskMeAnything

WIP - A dialogflow agent acting through a web interface for a portfolio website.

## What it does

Currently, it replies to hello and yes and no. Basically, I have not touched the dialogflow agent as of now. I am planning to add a lot of small talk and my own personal bio so if stands up to the name "AskMeAnything".

## Contributing
I would very much appreciate contributions. Please check out the issues if you're interested. Stay tuned, it's just the beginning. The project will be more concrete and generalized later on so that anyone might be able to add a conversational interface to their personal website.
